In computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of working on it with various algorithms. Each data structure contains information about the data values, relationships between the data and functions that can be applied to the data.

Characteristics of data structures
Data structures are often classified by their characteristics. Possible characteristics are:

Linear or non-linear: This characteristic describes whether the data items are arranged in chronological sequence, such as with an array, or in an unordered sequence, such as with a graph.
Homogeneous or non-homogeneous: This characteristic describes whether all data items in a given repository are of the same type or of various types.
